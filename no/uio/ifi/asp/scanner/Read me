About the code.

we have done and test all required functionality. we are not happy about the code cleanness.
due to time shortage we cant clean and comment as we wish.


Additionally,
We have done test function that compares the log file generated by our program and
the reference log files given.
The functions takes the base file name of asp file and,  compare files with basename.log and
the file which has same basename + ref.log which is given on the course materials.

It cheeks line by line and if there is mismatch, it will print the line number on the terminal
like this
     line no 3 Error
      	   3: # ---
      	   3: # ---
if you are not comfortable you can comment // line 78 on main.java.
thanks.
